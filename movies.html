<p><b>Titanic</b>
<p>Titanic is a very sad movie but it's also a very good movie at the same time.I also loved the characters, Jack and Rose,
because their love story is so sweet but also very tragic 
like many relationships.I also loved the forbidden love type idea in their relationship.Everything about this scene is so perfect.The setting,the sky in the background,the music,this has to be one of the most romantic scenes ever in movie history.</p>

<p><b>Twilight</b> 
<p>The movie is about a teenage girl Bella and her boyfriend Edward.Edward is a vampire.Its a beautiful love story like no other.completely different.Im sure that there will never be a story like this.Thats something what every girl dreams about,a perfect boyfriend who would do anything for her.And I think that the fact that hes a vampire is so cool.He can read other peoples mind, he is cold,he can run fast,he is so strong.I would like to have all of that.But its a love story,love story between a girl and a vampire.Thats the sweetest thing.</p>
