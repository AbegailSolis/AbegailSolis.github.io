<p><b>Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</b>
<p>this drama is one that I really followed since my favorite second actor is starring in it.now that it was simply finished,
I think it left a hole in my heart.it was a very fun drama with a lot of suspense and a bit of everything else</p>

<p><b>The Legend of the blue sea</b>

<p><b>Doctor Stranger</b>
<p>It is that kind of a drama where you can't guess the plot till the last minute.It had so many plot twists!Medical drama +Suspense+Lee Jong Suk=THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN.Anyone who watches this would fall in love with doctors and surgeries and
medical stuff.</p>

<p><b>Missing You</b>
<p>I really love this drama,Its all about truth,justice,family,hope and true love.
This drama beautifully demonstrates positive ways to cope with life when facing difficulties.It also teaches lessons of what might not be the best way to deal with difficulties.I'm impressed with the acting of the three main characters </p>

<p><b>Descendants of the Sun</b>
<p>I love the show because its one of a kind show.I have never seen a love story of a soldier and a doctor.This show proved itself as one of the best shows.From OSTs to acting to plot to the chemistry,everything worked out great.I think that it was the drama which contained every genre in it.From romance,comedy,actions to drama it have everything.</p>

<p><b>Scarlet Heart Ryeo</b>
<p>This is the best historical drama that i have ever watched. No one can ever beat Scarlet Heart Ryeo.It ruined my heart and soul, but it is worth it.All the acting of the characters are very surreal and amazing.They all give life to their characters. We can all feel your true emotions.The OSTs all come from the heart.</p>
